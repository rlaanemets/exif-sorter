exif-sorter
===========


!Work in progress!

The objective is to write a program, which would read the EXIF data
from jpg-s from a given directory, then make desired operations with them.

I have a working sorter based on PIL (sorter.py) at this point. The other .py files are bits and pieces of code written in the progress. The sorter is not very user friendly or up to normal programming standards I think, but it works.
It can sort jpg-s with exif data to folders based on six attributes, shutter speed, aperture, ISO speed, focal length, date and camera model.


Next I'll try to make it a bit more usable, and try to standardise it.


I now seem to have some idea what I am doing.
