!Work in a slow progress!

The objective is to write a program, which would read the EXIF data from image files (jpg-s at first) from a given directory, then make desired operations with them.

The capabilities of the final program will be determined with the speed of my progress, the first goal is to make a sorter based on either shutter speed, aperture value, or ISO speed (or maybe even a combination of these parameters), or to display some statistics derived from these three parameters.

I have no idea what I am doing.
